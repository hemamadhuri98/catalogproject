# CatalogProject
Fourth project in fullstack nanodegree course is ItemCatalog
-This project is to create our own catalog and allows users to login into the
system and add different types of items to the database. Each user is the owner
of the items they have added and no other user can modify those items. Also, no 
unauthenticated user has the right to make changes to the database.
### Why This Project?
Modern web applications perform a variety of functions and provide amazing
features and utilities to their users; but deep down, it’s really all just
